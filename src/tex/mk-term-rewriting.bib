  abstract = {The success of the symbolic mathematical computation discipline is striking. The theoretical advances have been continuous and significant: Gr\"obner bases, the Risch integration algorithm, integer lattice basis reduction, hypergeometric summation algorithms, etc. From the beginning in the early 1960s, it has been the tradition of our discipline to create software that makes our ideas readily available to scientists, engineers, and educators: SAC-1, Reduce, Macsyma, etc. The commercial viability of our system products is proven by Maple and Mathematica. Today's user communities of symbolic computation systems are diverse: educators, engineers, stock market analysts, etc. The mathematics and computer science in the design and implementation of our algorithms are sophisticated. The research challenges in symbolic computation at the close of the twentieth century are formidable. I state my favorite eight open problems in symbolic computation. They range from problems in symbolic/numeric computing, symbolic algorithm synthesis, to system component construction. I have worked on seven of my problems and borrowed one from George Collins. I present background to each of my problems and a clear-cut test that evaluates whether a proposed attack has solved one of my problems. An additional ninth open problem by Rob Corless and David Jeffrey on complex function semantics is given in an appendix.},

  abstract = {We survey termination analysis techniques for Logic Programs. We give an extensive introduction to the topic. We recall several motivations for the work, and point out the intuitions behind a number of LP-specific issues that turn up, such as: the study of different classes of programs and LP languages, of different classes of queries and of different selection rules, the difference between existential and universal termination, and the treatment of backward unification and local variables. Then, we turn to more technical aspects: the structure of the termination proofs, the selection of well-founded orderings, norms and level mappings, the inference of interargument relations, and special treatments proposed for dealing with mutual recursion. For each of these, we briefly sketch the main approaches presented in the literature, using a fixed example as a file rouge. We conclude with some comments on loop detection and cycle unification and state some open problems.},

  abstract = {Synthesizing programs using example input/outputs is a classic problem in artificial intelligence. We present a method for solving Programming By Example (PBE) problems by using a neural model to guide the search of a constraint logic programming system called miniKanren. Crucially, the neural model uses miniKanren's internal representation as input; miniKanren represents a PBE problem as recursive constraints imposed by the provided examples. We explore Recurrent Neural Network and Graph Neural Network models. We contribute a modified miniKanren, drivable by an external agent, available at https://github.com/xuexue/neuralkanren. We show that our neural-guided approach using constraints can synthesize programs faster in many cases, and importantly, can generalize to larger problems.},
